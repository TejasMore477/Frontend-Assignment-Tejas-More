# Solar System 3D Simulation

A beautiful and interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js. This project demonstrates the use of 3D graphics, animations, and user interactions in a web browser.

## Features

- Realistic 3D representation of the solar system with all planets
- Interactive speed controls for each planet's orbital speed
- Shooting stars effect with customizable generation
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- Beautiful star field background
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-friendly controls with toggle functionality

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- OrbitControls for camera manipulation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. No build process or dependencies required!

## Controls

### Desktop

- Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust the orbital speed of each planet
- Click and drag to rotate the view
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Click "Create Shooting Star" to generate shooting stars
- Toggle "Start/Stop Shooting Stars" for automatic generation

### Mobile

- Tap the "Controller" button to show/hide speed controls
- Use the sliders to adjust planet speeds
- Pinch to zoom
- Tap and drag to rotate the view
- Use the shooting star button to create effects

## Planet Speed Controls

- Mercury: 0-5x speed
- Venus: 0-5x speed
- Earth: 0-5x speed
- Mars: 0-5x speed
- Jupiter: 0-5x speed
- Saturn: 0-5x speed
- Uranus: 0-5x speed
- Neptune: 0-5x speed

## Browser Support
